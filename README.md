# Virtual Pets Amok!

### Application
You are responsible for keeping track of the pets' needs. This shelter
includes both organic and robotic pets. They all share happiness, boredom, and
health attributes. The goal of the game is to keep them happy and healthy, play
with them often, but be careful-- be sure you're also paying attention to the
organic pets' hunger, thirst, and the cleanliness of their cages, but also keeping
track of the robotic pets' oil levels.

### Virtual Pets
This class will hold the common attributes of all pets. 

### Organic Dog and Cat Class
This class holds the hunger, thirst, and cleanliness of the organic pets. The cats
will be played with, while the dogs can be walked all at once.

### Robotic Pets Class
This class has the oil method for only the robotic pets. You're not supposed to oil
a **chihuahua**.

### Shelter
This class has a map of all the pets in the shelter, allowing you to walk dogs, feed, water
or oil the pets.
